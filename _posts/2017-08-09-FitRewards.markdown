Fitgift is a hybrid mobile app to motivate people to get fit. Pick and charge your credit card for a prize from Amazon, which won't be received until the fitness goal is met. Once achieved, one press ships the prize to your address and sends a text message to loved ones about your success. It developed during Northwestern's WildHacks.
