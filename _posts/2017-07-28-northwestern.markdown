All of this wouldn't have been possible without my learning at Northwestern and the many other projects I completed here. These include constructing a compiler, creating a game in machine code, adding functionality to the xv6 operating system, running machine learning to make accurate predictions, manipulating public database information to complete a political party map, creating an AI to solve Sudoku, and much more.
